# Starter with Graphql Apollo 🍇, React Hooks 🌿

Demo of a suspicious 🔏 transactions flagging app using GraphQL (Apollo) and React (Hooks).

![Demo](https://github.com/ahmadalibaloch/graphql_apollo_react_hooks_transactions_demo/blob/master/demo.png)

A 'server' app that makes transactions information accessible via GraphQL queries and updates subscriptions, and a 'client' web app containing a simple React-based web application with Material Design UI. Client app has a Grid of transactions which could be marked as allowed or blocked and the in memory database on server side persists the changes.  

## Server App
In ./server/ start the web server using
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Web App
In ./client/ start the web server using
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

A browser should automatically navigate to
 ```http://localhost:3000/```

 added a simple license to upload on github and share
